title: Influence of scaling effect from sample mass during the synthesis of biochar
subtitle: An investigation using a TGA as a lab-scale reactor to synthesize non-graphitizing carbon from biomass

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Scaling effect due to sample mass influences the synthesis of non-graphitizing carbon such as biochar in lab-scale reactors such as TGA. An investigation to reveal how these changes influences the pyrolysis process and resulting carbon structure.
