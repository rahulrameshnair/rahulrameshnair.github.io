The focus of my work is on the development, hybridization and optimization of multifunctional nanocomposites derived from biogenic carbon sources for atmospheric carbon sequestration in soil, direct air capture (DAC) and industrial applications (such as highly selective adsorption of persistent pollutants). The application of these materials in soil, either for C-sequestration or at the end of their life cycle, explores their impacts on soil properties and soil-microbial ecosystem. This research  lies at the intersection of process engineering, material sciences and environmental life cycle modelling and aims to develop novel and economic materials and/or processes that can be deployed atscale in future.
